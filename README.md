chromite-bug-bounty special topic coursework

This repository consists of python scripts to generate RISC-V assembly for testing the Regfile + Bypass + Scoreboard in the Chromite core developed by incore semiconductors

The Register file is a part of the decode stage in the pipeline. It consists of 32 registers. There are 2 read ports and 1 write port. The length of each register is parametrizable at instantiation and for our testing we have considered length of 32 . 

Bypass hardware : Using pipeline design ,the  RISC processor operates at more than one cycle per instruction; the processor might occasionally encounter a  stall as a  result of data dependencies and branch instructions. When an instruction depends on the previous instruction,data dependency occurs.A particular instruction might need data in a register which has not yet been stored since the preceding instruction which has not yet reached that stage  in the pipeline.
In these cases the bypass logic takes care so that correct values of are used for the exection of each instruction .

# Code Description

### uatg_registers_walking1.py
* in this test register write of 0x1 is performed with left shifting it after each write .
* leftshifted 1 bit is loaded . 
* checked if the loaded register has a non zero value . if its zero executinon jumps to trap and incremets x31 
* value of 1 less than the left shifted variable is loaded to the next register and the two registers are anded . 
* if the anded value is not equal to 0 , a trap is raised . 
* This test checks for stuck at 0 glitches .

### uatg_bypass_arithmatic.py
* a legal random number A is loaded to a register Xi
* a legal random number B is loaded to a register Xi+1
* a legal random number C is added to the Xi and stored to Xi+1
* a legal random number D is added to the Xi+1 and stored to Xi+2
* A+C+D is loaded to Xi+3 
* If the value at Xi+2 doesnt match that aat Xi+3 , a trap is raised .
* this tests if the correct value of Xi+1 is bypassed from the execution stage to the decode stage for the next instruction
